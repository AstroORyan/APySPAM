Welcome to APySPAM's documentation!
===================================

``APySPAM`` is a Python package for running interacting galaxy simulations. It takes in 16 different parameters, and returns the morphology, star formation rate distribution and flux distribution of the resultant systems.

What it can do
---------------

The Advanced Python Stellar Animation Module (APySPAM) is a numerical galaxy interaction modeller based on the earlier work of John Wallin and Anthony Holincheck in the Java Stellar Particle Animation Module (JSPAM). From a selection of parameters that the user 
can tweak, this algorithm will force an interaction to occur and output images of the final morphology of the system as well as tables containing the flux distribution and star formation rate (SFR) distribution of the final system. 

For a full description of the astrophysics of the algorithm, as well as some further use cases please see the output paper that came with this documentation (ArXiv:$INSERT_ARCHIVE_NO). The aim of this documentation is to give a very high level overview of each of the 
different scripts the user might have to interct with, some example results as well as some basic and advanced tutorials in its use. I hope that the user finds this algorithm helpful with the work they are pursuing! Any issues or errors that you encounter in the
algorithm, please contact the author this documentation David O'Ryan at d.oryan@lancaster.ac.uk.
