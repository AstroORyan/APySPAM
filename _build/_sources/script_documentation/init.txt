Full Module Descriptions
---------------------------

This section will be a full breakdown of every module in PySPAM, as well as going into detail about
each module in the original JSPAM which has been ported over. If you are looking to just get this
algorithm and get some simulations running, I'd recommend looking at the example sections! This
section will go into far more detail than you need.

If youre having problems in specific modules or setups, it might be best to check the FAQ section
first. If issues are still being encountered, this section is the place to be! If this section 
doesn't solve your problem, please don't hesitate to email me with questions/bug fixes at
d.oryan@lancaster.ac.uk.

This section will consist of a brief description of each file in the module, followed by detailed
descriptions of each function. For the docstrings, see the actual code! 

So, with that out of the way, let's get started...

colour
========
``colour.py`` is the most computationally intense module in the overall algorithm. It is where the 
colour fluxes of each particle are calculated. This must be done by calculating the ages and stellar
masses of each particles population throughout the entire simulation. The functions to do this are 
contained in here. 

Constants
==========
``Constants.py`` is a utility module which was in the original JSPAM. While not used explicitly in 
APySPAM, it is very useful to be able to quickly see how to convert from simulation units to physical
units. For reference, a table of the conversions is shown below:

**INSERT_TABLE**


ForceModel
============
This function is what calculates the forces on each particle, based upon the underlying physical model 
the user has inputted (i.e, NB, MOND or SPM). This utilises a Runge-Kutta update algorithm to calculate
all new positions and velocities of the particles at each time step using the given model.



Gas_Dist
=========
``Gas_Dist`` is an initialization function. It utilises a user specified gas distribution model over the
disk of the galaxy to give a gas fraction to each particle. This gas fraction will later be used to 
weight the total star formation that can occur in each particle throughout the simulation. 

Integrator
============
Module from the original JSPAM algorithm. This conducts the actual integration of updating the particles
position and velocities from the ForceModel script.

IOUtil
========
This is another utility function. Standing for Input-Output Utility, it conducts imports of the colour
filters the user wants to simulate viewing the interacting systems through. It also conducts the two
saving functions to a ``.txt`` and ``.npy`` file. Go here if you want to edit paths manually rather 
than specifying in the CLI input.

MathUtil
==========
A final utility function which contains many used astrophysical equations for speedup. Using 
functionality like this decreases computation time, so is very useful.

MONDModel
===========
This function calculates the total forces on each particle in the simulation from either unit galaxy.
This assumes a Modified Newtonian Dynamic (MOND) cosmology. All forces calculated in this script are
output to ``Integrator``.


NBIModel
===========
If selected by the user, this function will calculate the total force and direction on each particle
using a Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology in a purely N-body model. All forces calculated in this script
are output to ``Integrator``.

Parameters
===========
A file containing a list of all the parameters that a user can adjust. This file is easier to use as the
input than attempting to type in all the parameters in the CLI. If the user wishes, however, the 
parameters can be updated directly in the Setup Utility function. This file serves as a good reference
for what can be adjusted.

Plotting_Function
===================
This file contains all functions required for mapping out the physical light distributions of the 
resulting galactic morphologies. If the user wishes, they can activate this mapping for each filter
individually, a lupton_rgb map (a close approximation to an actual observation in the filters), a gas
distribution map and a star formation map. By default, this function only creates and saves a white light
image. 

Also note, a flag can be used to execute this function over numerous timestep intervals, giving the user
the ability to make a film of the interaction occurring. This, however, massively increases the 
computational expense of the module. 

Run 
====
The main module of the algorithm, and the one I'm going to spend the most time talking about. This
function is where we run the entire simulation from, and has many functions linking to all of the other
modules described here. 

SEDs
=======
This file contains all functions necessary for creating, updating and overwriting the Spectral Energy
Distributions of each particle. Note, this file mainly deals with setup and manipulation of these
results. All calculations are done in other files.

SetupUtil
============
This is the Setup Utility file, containing all the functions required for setting up the interaction.
In this file, the user can alter the initial parameters of the interaction, as well as change some
flags as to how the interaction will be forced.

SFR_Calculation
================
This is a rapid function which is called in every timestep. It calculates the star formation rate at
each timestep and then converts this into a total mass formed at each particle in each timestep. This
is then returned as the total mass of a new stellar population at each timestep.

SPMModel
===========
This function calculates the force on each particle from both unit galaxy's assuming a Softened Point 
Mass potential. This is slightly more computationally intense than the other two users, but can lead to 
more accurate final representations of morphology.
